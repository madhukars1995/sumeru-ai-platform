# Sumeru AI Development Continuation Guide

## 🎯 What We've Accomplished

### 1. Smart Polling System
- ✅ Created `SmartPollingManager` with intelligent API call management
- ✅ Implemented adaptive intervals based on response times
- ✅ Added priority-based job scheduling (high/medium/low)
- ✅ Built comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools
- ✅ Re-enabled API calls in MetaGPT and Agent components

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Reduced excessive API calls with global throttling
- ✅ Implemented adaptive polling intervals
- ✅ Added failure detection and retry logic
- ✅ Created performance monitoring dashboard

### 3. Component Updates
- ✅ Updated `MetaGPTPanel` to use smart polling
- ✅ Updated `AgentStatusPanel` to use smart polling
- ✅ Added `SmartPollingDebug` component for monitoring
- ✅ Re-enabled all previously disabled API calls

## 🚀 Next Steps to Continue

### 1. Test the Smart Polling System
```bash
# In the browser console, run:
import('./src/utils/testSmartPolling.ts').then(m => m.testSmartPolling())
```

### 2. Monitor Performance
- Open the browser and check the Smart Polling Debug panel (bottom-right corner)
- Monitor API call frequency and success rates
- Adjust polling intervals if needed

### 3. Continue with MetaGPT Integration
- Test agent creation and task execution
- Verify file generation and output display
- Check real-time agent status updates

### 4. Frontend Enhancements
- Complete the Planner pane with Kanban board
- Implement the Terminal pane with real terminal
- Add file preview and editing capabilities
- Enhance the analytics dashboard

### 5. Backend Improvements
- Optimize database queries
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add API rate limiting

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Polling Intervals
- **Agents**: 30 seconds (real-time updates)
- **Tasks**: 1 minute (status updates)
- **Files**: 2 minutes (file changes)
- **Conversations**: 30 seconds (chat updates)
- **Analytics**: 5 minutes (performance data)

### Performance Settings
- **Max Concurrent Requests**: 2
- **Request Debounce**: 500ms
- **Cache Expiry**: 5 minutes
- **Min Polling Interval**: 10 seconds

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

### 1. API Call Frequency
- Monitor if the new intervals are appropriate
- Adjust based on actual usage patterns
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time updates

### 2. Error Handling
- Add proper error boundaries for failed API calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Show user-friendly error messages

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Track memory usage and optimize if needed
- Monitor bundle size and loading times
- Implement proper loading states

## 🎯 Priority Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Test the smart polling system** - Verify it's working correctly
2. **Monitor API call frequency** - Ensure we're not overwhelming the server
3. **Test MetaGPT integration** - Verify agents and tasks work properly

### Medium Priority
1. **Complete the Planner pane** - Implement Kanban board functionality
2. **Add file management** - Implement file creation, editing, and preview
3. **Enhance analytics** - Add more detailed performance metrics

### Low Priority
1. **Add WebSocket support** - For real-time updates
2. **Implement caching** - For better performance
3. **Add unit tests** - For reliability

## 🔍 Debugging Tools

### Smart Polling Debug Panel
- Located in bottom-right corner (development only)
- Shows active jobs and their status
- Displays success/failure rates
- Allows toggling adaptive mode

### Browser Console
- Check for API call logs
- Monitor error messages
- Test smart polling with `testSmartPolling()`

### Network Tab
- Monitor API call frequency
- Check response times
- Verify no excessive requests

## 📝 Development Commands

```bash
# Start the development environment
./dev.sh

# Or manually:
cd coordinator && python3 -m uvicorn server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Test the smart polling system
# Open browser console and run:
import('./src/utils/testSmartPolling.ts').then(m => m.testSmartPolling())
```

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ No more excessive API calls
- ✅ Responsive UI with real-time updates
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ Performance monitoring in place
- ✅ Smart adaptive polling working

## 🚀 Ready to Continue!

The smart polling system is now in place and should prevent the excessive API calls you were experiencing. The system will:

1. **Intelligently manage API calls** - Only make calls when needed
2. **Adapt to performance** - Adjust intervals based on response times
3. **Prioritize important updates** - High priority jobs get executed first
4. **Provide monitoring** - Debug panel shows what's happening
5. **Handle failures gracefully** - Retry logic and error recovery

You can now continue developing the MetaGPT integration and other features without worrying about overwhelming the server with API calls!
